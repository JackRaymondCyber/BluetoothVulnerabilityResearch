Both tools are written in python 3 and are meant to be executed on Linux based systems.

Bleedingfix can only update to the latest kernel on Debian based distributions that use the apt package manager.
Crackfix requires that Crackle (https://github.com/mikeryan/crackle) is compiled and is in the same directory as the Crackfix tool. Crackfix also requires that the bluez and bluez-tools packages be installed.

**Bleedingfix usage:**
./bleedingfix
**Crackfix usage:**
./crackfix (file path of encrypted pcap capture)

The commented-out lines in the Crackfix tool that have the word “testing” may be used to spoof various conditions to trigger each of the output cases.
